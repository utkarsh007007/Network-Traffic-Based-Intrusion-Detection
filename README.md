# Network-Traffic-Based-Intrusion-Detection
This project started as an attempt to better understand how machine learning models can be used to analyze network traffic and detect suspicious behavior.  Rather than focusing on a single algorithm, I compared multiple classical ML models and observed how feature selection and model choice affect performance.
